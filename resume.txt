FINAL STATEMENT

I am new to Computer Science and I am loving every second of it. I wrote my first line of code on Codecademy.com in October of 2013. Two months later I enrolled in Harvard's (free!) Introduction to Computer Programming through edX.org and my world changed completely.

After I completed the course, LaunchCode, a Saint Louis not-for-profit, set me up with an interview for an apprenticeship at Fusion Marketing. On the day after my interview I was offered the position based on my genuine excitement for Computer Science, my ability to learn programming languages and concepts quickly, and the fact that I got along well with the team.

I did well in the apprenticeship (LaunchCode even featured me! http://www.launchcode.org), and as a result I was offered a full-time job as a Junior Developer. The folks at Fusion taught me so much and I am forever indebted to them for taking me on. Fusion is an excellent company to work for - I can't say enough positive things about the company or the people that make it.

Recently, though, I decided to move home to Chicago from Saint Louis. This is where my family is, and where my heart has always been.

Now I'm excited to find a job in Chicago where I can continue to grow, but perhaps slow down a bit and let the depth of everything I've learned sink in. That said, I wouldn't mind learning a new language or framework or two.
