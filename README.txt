Currently just serving static files with a plain node.js backend.

However... Muahahaha

I have an idea to do something pretty fun.

I'll hit this espn endpoint to get the current mlb status for games.

Using the data from that I'll generate an image.

When that image is done being generated I'll send a static html page that asks for it (along with CSS file)

If there is an error anywhere along the way, I'll just send a different static html page that asks for a pre-prepared image (maybe a random one of my gifs (ouch, though, that would be a lot of space). It's worth it for now.
